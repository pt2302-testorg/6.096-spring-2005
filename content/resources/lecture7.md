  and hidden markov models, HMM (hidden markov model), typical HMM problems, CpG islands,
  training markov chains for CpG islands, decoding, the viterbi algorithm, generating
  a sequence by the model, the forward algorithm, relation between forward and viterbi,
  pseudocounts, the baum-welch algorithm, HMM architectural/topology design and VEIL:
  viterbi exon-intron locator.'
